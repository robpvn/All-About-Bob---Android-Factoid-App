#A simple app that can show factoids about a person

This is a simple Android app with a picture, a countdown/up timer and a series of interesting facts about a person/place/event, designed to be easily customisable. Originally created as a birthday present for my brother, it also gave me some training in using branches in Git as I endeavoured to keep a generic master and use branches to make person-specific customisations.

Due to its nature, this app is not on the app store, nor does it have a precompiled binary. If you want to try it out, you can download the code, customise it by changing strings.xml and profile.jpg (nothing else!), then compile it with Eclipse and the Android SDK. The layout is specially designed to fit with and only tested on a HTC Desire Z, but it should easily fit most phones. 

Has not been updated or maintained since the Android 2.x days, so probably looks pretty bad by today's standards.
